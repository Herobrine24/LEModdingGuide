			<li>Automatic Game Updates for the game is disabled if that options is available on your store platform</li>

			<li>If you previously modded the games, ensure you have fresh installs of the games (Repairs are not clean!)</li>

			<li>You have a free or premium NexusMods account</li>
			<li>You're on Windows 8/10/11 (The tools might run on other OS too but you won't receive any official support)</li>

    <b><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition/mods/2" target="_blank">Download the Mod Manager</a></b>
    <p>The Mod Manager or M3 is an end-user tool intended for installing content mods for Mass Effect and was made by the ME3Tweaks Team, the team behind the LegendaryExplorer toolset that all modders use to create mods.<br><br>

    After downloading the Mod Manager, install it in an easy to reach location like your Desktop.<br>
    Do not launch the Manager as Administrator to avoid Windows specific security limitations on its functionality.<br>
    Once it is opened, a small tutorial will present itself in a second window. Please take your time to familiarize yourself with the functions of the Mod Manager, as this is going to be the primary tool for modding Mass Effect.<br><br>

    Making a Backup of the games with Mod Manager is recommended, as it will allow you to restore individual modified basegame files, which is useful for removing some types of content mods and small texture mods.<br><br>

    You can also directly download mods from NexusMods by connecting your NexusMods account to M3 by clicking on the yellow NexusMods icon in the top right corner. Once you authorize it, you will be able to make use of the Vortex and Mod Manager Download buttons that you can see on most mod pages that will make the mods download directly into the Mod Manager. This also allows you to directly endorse them in the Manager with the Endorse Mod button when you select a mod from the mod library.

A comprehensive, often updated modding guide for the Legendary Edition, written by Herobrine24.
This guide is intended for those that have and have not yet played Mass Effect.
It includes mod lists for both first playthroughs and non-first playthroughs and instructions on installing both content and texture mods with ME3Tweaks Mod Manager and Mass Effect Modder in a spoiler free manner.




1. Introduction and Preparation

This Guide covers the installation of content and texture mods in general and lists mods that I personally recommend or find interesting for the Legendary Edition for both first playthroughs and non-first playthroughs and has spoiler free installation instructions.

If you want to mod the Original Trilogy instead, click here.

You should always inform yourself on every mod that you will be installing to know what it does, what other mods it does and doesn’t work with, what current bugs it has, if that is something that you actually need or want, etc. 
Don’t go off installing all the mods in this guide without consideration, this is not a conflictless collection!

Before beginning, ensure that…
The games were launched at least once after they have been installed
If on Origin, “Enable Origin In-Game” is set to off in the Origin Application’s Settings
Automatic Game Updates for the game is disabled if that options is available on your store platform
There's plenty of free space on your PC (up to ~250GB for all game backups and mods listed in the guide)
The Graphics settings in all 3 games have been set to your preferences
If you previously modded the games, ensure you have fresh installs of the games (Repairs are not clean!)
The games and modding tools are whitelisted in your Anti-Virus’ settings (Especially with Avast and AVG)
You have a free or premium NexusMods account
You're on Windows 8/10/11 (The tools might run on other OS too but you won't receive any official support)
The games are preferably set to english (Not all mods fully support all the non-english languages)

If you only want to mod textures, skip to section 5. and proceed from there.

For first playthroughs, the mod list in 3A. is spoiler free and has no drastically content changing mods.
Start from section 2. for the Mod Manager and end with section 4. for installation instructions.
Section 5. continues with texture mod instructions and mod list. 

For non-first playthroughs, the mod list in 3B. contains a wide variety of mods, regardless of spoilers.
Start from section 2. for the Mod Manager and end with section 4. for installation instructions.
Section 5. continues with texture mod instructions and mod list.

Alternatively you can use the Outline on the left of your screen to navigate all sections.

If you are looking for something specific, press CTRL+F and type in what you’re looking for or use the document outline on the left to navigate to specific sections of the guide.

All text that is blue is a clickable link.

I take no responsibility for issues created by modifying the games. You should always create backups before attempting to mod them and only refer to official download sources such as NexusMods and any of the official support Discord Servers listed at the end of this guide.

Last Updated: 10.MAR.2022
Added Disable Depth of Field while Aiming, Turtlenecks for Male Shepard, Assorted Femshep Hairstyles, More Vanilla-like Femshep Hairstyles, Restored Karpov Pistol, Leather Jacket for Femshep, Return to Normandy Button, Morning’s Outfits for Femshep PT3, Liara’s Prologue Armor for LotSB, Honest Fuel Depot, Assassin Krios, Early-Ish, Nilin Drip, No Depleted Rich Resources Tags, Cerberus Daily News Emails, Virmire Savior Mod, Keep Horizon Normal, Miranda’s Long walk, Big Guddamn Hero, Jack’s Shore Leave, IFF Dialogue Tweak, Jane’s Pajamas, Jane’s Alliance Casual Outfit, Alliance Dress Blues Redesigned, Morning's Accessories for Shepard, Apartment Additions, Tali Consistency Mod, Virmire Survivor Respect, Bakara's Gift, Citadel Epilogue Mod, Pinnacle Station Apartment, Rounded selector, Disavowed
Removed additional installation steps mentioning Black Market License having to be installed first 

2. Content Mods and ME3Tweaks Mod Manager     [DOWNLOAD HERE]

The Mod Manager or M3 is an end-user tool intended for installing content mods for Mass Effect and was made by the ME3Tweaks Team, the team behind the LegendaryExplorer toolset that all modders use to create mods.

After downloading the Mod Manager, install it in an easy to reach location like your Desktop.
Do not launch the Manager as Administrator to avoid Windows specific security limitations on its functionality.
Once it is opened, a small tutorial will present itself in a second window. Please take your time to familiarize yourself with the functions of the Mod Manager, as this is going to be the primary tool for modding Mass Effect.

Making a Backup of the games with Mod Manager is recommended, as it will allow you to restore individual modified basegame files, which is useful for removing some types of content mods and small texture mods.

You can also directly download mods from NexusMods by connecting your NexusMods account to M3 by clicking on the yellow NexusMods icon in the top right corner. Once you authorize it, you will be able to make use of the Vortex and Mod Manager Download buttons that you can see on most mod pages that will make the mods download directly into the Mod Manager. This also allows you to directly endorse them in the Manager with the Endorse Mod button when you select a mod from the mod library.

It also has these notable additional features:
Mod Update Notifications - Mods opted in by their authors will notify you of updates in the Manager
In-Game Console - Automatically enables the in-game console and lets you rebind its keys in the Tools Tab
Batch Installer - Allows you to set up a list of mods you want to install from the library
Diagnostics - Allows mod authors and tool devs to better help you with technical issues via the Help Tab
Integrated External Tools - Easily access third party tools and mod specific settings apps via the tools tab
Autoboot - Lets you bypass the launcher and directly launch the game that you’ve selected

If you want to edit your saves, use the Mass Effect Trilogy Save Editor.




All Mass Effect Trilogy Mods are available on NexusMods, feel free to explore the place.


Once you have downloaded the content mods you want, proceed to section 4. below for installation instructions and texture mods below that.


Please consider endorsing the mods you like on NexusMods.

4. Installing Content Mods with M3

Installation is mostly straightforward, just follow the steps:
Drag&amp;Drop the mods (.7z) individually into the Manager and click Import to store them, do not extract mods
You can also directly download mods into the manager after setting up NexusMods integration explained in section 2 and then pressing on the Vortex or Download with Mod Manager buttons on the mod pages

Make sure you imported all the mods you want and then proceed with installing them
You can use the blue filter buttons at the top of the mod list to hide mods for a specific game and the Legendary Edition / Original Trilogy buttons at the top right to filter by trilogy version

You don’t have to install all mods for all three games right away, you can do so on a per game basis too

Some mods may say on their mod page that they are no longer supported. This only means that they are no longer going to receive any further updates but are completely safe to install.

Select a mod and press the “Apply Mod” button at the bottom right of the Manager
Some mods require additional steps for correct installation, always read all instructions!
Shepard Cosmetic/Hair Mods require using Trilogy Save Editor to apply their content
LE2 Liara Squadmate may require using its auto patcher program for other mods

If you are prompted with a list of install options after pressing “Apply Mod”:
Make sure that you select compatibility patch options for all mods that you’ll install
If you can't select a patch for a mod you're also going to install, install that other mod first and the patch should then be automatically selected

Pick your desired customizations
If options are unclear, check the Mod Pages for possible further information 

If you installed Expanded Galaxy Mod or FemShep v. BroShep, you can always access their settings windows in the Manager’s Tools Tab

Once you are satisfied with your selection, press the “Install” button

You can check what mods you already installed by clicking on "Manage Target"
Some mods install into the basegame and are found in the “Modified basegame files” tab
Installing texture mods will prevent that information from being shown but the mods will still be working

Ensure that you have installed all the mods you want, applied the necessary compatibility patches and customized the mods to your liking.
 
When you’re 100% done with content mods, you can move on to installing any texture mods with the instructions in section 5.

Uninstalling Content Mods
To uninstall content mods, simply click on Manage Target at the top right of the Mod Manager, select the game you want to remove content mods from, go to the installed DLC mods tab and press on the delete button next to the content mods you want to delete.

Some content mods add their changes directly into the basegame files. To remove those changes, switch to the modified basegame files tab in the same menu and press on the restore button next to the modified files. 
Restoring basegame files requires game backups made with Mod Manager. 

Note that the mods listed on the left of the main Mod Manager window is not a list of installed mods but is the list of mods that were imported into the Manager’s storage. 

5. Texture Mods and Mass Effect Modder (MEM)     Tools Tab in Mod Manager or [STANDALONE APP]

Mass Effect Modder or MEM is the texture modding tool for the Legendary Edition.

Before installing texture mods, ensure that you installed all the content mods you want because once you install texture mods, you cannot install/update further content mods. Only further texture mods, which will overwrite existing texture mods can be installed at that point. Installing/Updating content mods after installing texture mods requires completely deleting and/or restoring the modified files or full game from a backup or by redownloading the game (Repairs sometimes leave extra files or skip modified files). 


Installing Texture Mods
First, click on Mods Manager for the game that you want to mod and then click on Mods Installer. It will bring up a new menu where you can add one or several texture mods to a temporary install list.

Note that the order of installation matters with textures. Install wide-scale texture mods (like ALOT) first. Any smaller mods have to come after. If the order is reversed, the smaller texture mods will be overwritten. 

After adding the desired texture mods to the list, just press on one of the install buttons.


Uninstalling Texture Mods
Removing small texture mods is possible by clicking on the Manage Target button in Mod Manager’s top right corner, selecting the texture modded game, going to the modified basegame files tab and clicking on restore on any modified files that do not have a mod name tied to them. Requires backup made with Mod Manager.
Some texture mods offer “vanilla” mod files as a restoration method on their download page. However these aren’t truly vanilla, as you are still installing a texture mod and these can lead to issues when installing content mods afterwards. Only if the file name ends with .pcc is the file truly vanilla. Otherwise, it’s just another modded file.

Removing large texture mods like ALOT is only possible by restoring the entire game from a backup or completely deleting and then reinstalling the game. Repairs don’t always completely clean the game!

A comprehensive, often updated modding guide for the Legendary Edition, written by Herobrine24.
This guide is intended for those that have and have not yet played Mass Effect.
It includes mod lists for both first playthroughs and non-first playthroughs and instructions on installing both content and texture mods with ME3Tweaks Mod Manager and Mass Effect Modder in a spoiler free manner.




1. Introduction and Preparation

This Guide covers the installation of content and texture mods in general and lists mods that I personally recommend or find interesting for the Legendary Edition for both first playthroughs and non-first playthroughs and has spoiler free installation instructions.

If you want to mod the Original Trilogy instead, click here.

You should always inform yourself on every mod that you will be installing to know what it does, what other mods it does and doesn’t work with, what current bugs it has, if that is something that you actually need or want, etc. 
Don’t go off installing all the mods in this guide without consideration, this is not a conflictless collection!

Before beginning, ensure that…
The games were launched at least once after they have been installed
If on Origin, “Enable Origin In-Game” is set to off in the Origin Application’s Settings
Automatic Game Updates for the game is disabled if that options is available on your store platform
There's plenty of free space on your PC (up to ~250GB for all game backups and mods listed in the guide)
The Graphics settings in all 3 games have been set to your preferences
If you previously modded the games, ensure you have fresh installs of the games (Repairs are not clean!)
The games and modding tools are whitelisted in your Anti-Virus’ settings (Especially with Avast and AVG)
You have a free or premium NexusMods account
You're on Windows 8/10/11 (The tools might run on other OS too but you won't receive any official support)
The games are preferably set to english (Not all mods fully support all the non-english languages)

If you only want to mod textures, skip to section 5. and proceed from there.

For first playthroughs, the mod list in 3A. is spoiler free and has no drastically content changing mods.
Start from section 2. for the Mod Manager and end with section 4. for installation instructions.
Section 5. continues with texture mod instructions and mod list. 

For non-first playthroughs, the mod list in 3B. contains a wide variety of mods, regardless of spoilers.
Start from section 2. for the Mod Manager and end with section 4. for installation instructions.
Section 5. continues with texture mod instructions and mod list.

Alternatively you can use the Outline on the left of your screen to navigate all sections.

If you are looking for something specific, press CTRL+F and type in what you’re looking for or use the document outline on the left to navigate to specific sections of the guide.

All text that is blue is a clickable link.

I take no responsibility for issues created by modifying the games. You should always create backups before attempting to mod them and only refer to official download sources such as NexusMods and any of the official support Discord Servers listed at the end of this guide.

The Mod Manager or M3 is an end-user tool intended for installing content mods for Mass Effect and was made by the ME3Tweaks Team, the team behind the LegendaryExplorer toolset that all modders use to create mods.

After downloading the Mod Manager, install it in an easy to reach location like your Desktop.
Do not launch the Manager as Administrator to avoid Windows specific security limitations on its functionality.
Once it is opened, a small tutorial will present itself in a second window. Please take your time to familiarize yourself with the functions of the Mod Manager, as this is going to be the primary tool for modding Mass Effect.

Making a Backup of the games with Mod Manager is recommended, as it will allow you to restore individual modified basegame files, which is useful for removing some types of content mods and small texture mods.

You can also directly download mods from NexusMods by connecting your NexusMods account to M3 by clicking on the yellow NexusMods icon in the top right corner. Once you authorize it, you will be able to make use of the Vortex and Mod Manager Download buttons that you can see on most mod pages that will make the mods download directly into the Mod Manager. This also allows you to directly endorse them in the Manager with the Endorse Mod button when you select a mod from the mod library.

It also has these notable additional features:
Mod Update Notifications - Mods opted in by their authors will notify you of updates in the Manager
In-Game Console - Automatically enables the in-game console and lets you rebind its keys in the Tools Tab
Batch Installer - Allows you to set up a list of mods you want to install from the library
Diagnostics - Allows mod authors and tool devs to better help you with technical issues via the Help Tab
Integrated External Tools - Easily access third party tools and mod specific settings apps via the tools tab
Autoboot - Lets you bypass the launcher and directly launch the game that you’ve selected

If you want to edit your saves, use the Mass Effect Trilogy Save Editor.




All Mass Effect Trilogy Mods are available on NexusMods, feel free to explore the place.


Once you have downloaded the content mods you want, proceed to section 4. below for installation instructions and texture mods below that.


Please consider endorsing the mods you like on NexusMods.

4. Installing Content Mods with M3

Installation is mostly straightforward, just follow the steps:
Drag&Drop the mods (.7z) individually into the Manager and click Import to store them, do not extract mods
You can also directly download mods into the manager after setting up NexusMods integration explained in section 2 and then pressing on the Vortex or Download with Mod Manager buttons on the mod pages

Make sure you imported all the mods you want and then proceed with installing them
You can use the blue filter buttons at the top of the mod list to hide mods for a specific game and the Legendary Edition / Original Trilogy buttons at the top right to filter by trilogy version

You don’t have to install all mods for all three games right away, you can do so on a per game basis too

Some mods may say on their mod page that they are no longer supported. This only means that they are no longer going to receive any further updates but are completely safe to install.

Select a mod and press the “Apply Mod” button at the bottom right of the Manager
Some mods require additional steps for correct installation, always read all instructions!
Shepard Cosmetic/Hair Mods require using Trilogy Save Editor to apply their content
LE2 Liara Squadmate may require using its auto patcher program for other mods

If you are prompted with a list of install options after pressing “Apply Mod”:
Make sure that you select compatibility patch options for all mods that you’ll install
If you can't select a patch for a mod you're also going to install, install that other mod first and the patch should then be automatically selected

Pick your desired customizations
If options are unclear, check the Mod Pages for possible further information 

If you installed Expanded Galaxy Mod or FemShep v. BroShep, you can always access their settings windows in the Manager’s Tools Tab

Once you are satisfied with your selection, press the “Install” button

You can check what mods you already installed by clicking on "Manage Target"
Some mods install into the basegame and are found in the “Modified basegame files” tab
Installing texture mods will prevent that information from being shown but the mods will still be working

Ensure that you have installed all the mods you want, applied the necessary compatibility patches and customized the mods to your liking.
 
When you’re 100% done with content mods, you can move on to installing any texture mods with the instructions in section 5.

Uninstalling Content Mods
To uninstall content mods, simply click on Manage Target at the top right of the Mod Manager, select the game you want to remove content mods from, go to the installed DLC mods tab and press on the delete button next to the content mods you want to delete.

Some content mods add their changes directly into the basegame files. To remove those changes, switch to the modified basegame files tab in the same menu and press on the restore button next to the modified files. 
Restoring basegame files requires game backups made with Mod Manager. 

Note that the mods listed on the left of the main Mod Manager window is not a list of installed mods but is the list of mods that were imported into the Manager’s storage. 

5. Texture Mods and Mass Effect Modder (MEM)     Tools Tab in Mod Manager or [STANDALONE APP]

Mass Effect Modder or MEM is the texture modding tool for the Legendary Edition.

Before installing texture mods, ensure that you installed all the content mods you want because once you install texture mods, you cannot install/update further content mods. Only further texture mods, which will overwrite existing texture mods can be installed at that point. Installing/Updating content mods after installing texture mods requires completely deleting and/or restoring the modified files or full game from a backup or by redownloading the game (Repairs sometimes leave extra files or skip modified files). 


Installing Texture Mods
First, click on Mods Manager for the game that you want to mod and then click on Mods Installer. It will bring up a new menu where you can add one or several texture mods to a temporary install list.

Note that the order of installation matters with textures. Install wide-scale texture mods (like ALOT) first. Any smaller mods have to come after. If the order is reversed, the smaller texture mods will be overwritten. 

After adding the desired texture mods to the list, just press on one of the install buttons.


Uninstalling Texture Mods
Removing small texture mods is possible by clicking on the Manage Target button in Mod Manager’s top right corner, selecting the texture modded game, going to the modified basegame files tab and clicking on restore on any modified files that do not have a mod name tied to them. Requires backup made with Mod Manager.
Some texture mods offer “vanilla” mod files as a restoration method on their download page. However these aren’t truly vanilla, as you are still installing a texture mod and these can lead to issues when installing content mods afterwards. Only if the file name ends with .pcc is the file truly vanilla. Otherwise, it’s just another modded file.

Removing large texture mods like ALOT is only possible by restoring the entire game from a backup or completely deleting and then reinstalling the game. Repairs don’t always completely clean the game!
